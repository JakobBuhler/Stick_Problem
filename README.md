# Stick_Problem
This repository contains an easy QUBO Problem showcasing the setup of the QUBO, Solution Plotting, and Algorithm Testing.

The file Stick_QUBO creates the class for QUBO creation.
File Functions_StickProblem defines any functions necessary to make code cleaner and sort/map solution
File Plot_Stick_Solution plots our Solution for testing if all Constraints are met and Solution matches expectation.
File Test_Algorithm_Stick uses the Stick Problem to test Algorithms and test their solution quality as well as runtime.
